Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This involves identifying and classifying opinions or emotions conveyed by the author, whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis has numerous applications in areas like customer feedback, social media monitoring, market research, and more
## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. The project uses various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to achieve this.
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
## Features
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
- Sentiment classification using machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, and Deep Learning models)
- Visualization of results
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis
- ## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of customer reviews from [source]. It contains labeled data with sentiments categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.
## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Clean and preprocess the text data.
    - Tokenize the reviews and remove stopwords.
    - Perform stemming or lemmatization.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**:
    - Train various machine learning models on the processed data.
    - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Prediction**:
    - Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new reviews.
